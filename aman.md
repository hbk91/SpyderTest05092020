            The duration of liabilities and assets are matched.
        iii. **Contingent Immunization:**
            As long as the Present Value of Assets (PVA) is more than the the Present Value of Liabilites (PVL), the portfolio could be actively managed.
            However, if PVA becomes smaller than the PVL, then the portfolio must be immediately immunized.
        iv. **Horizon Matching:**
            This is an intermediate strategy between cash-flow matching and Duration matching. The short term liabilites are cash-flow matched, while the
            long term liabilities are duration matched.
